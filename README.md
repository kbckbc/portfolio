## What is this about?
I'm updating my projects page(including class assignments) to record my work while I'm studying at WashU.

## Who am I?
I'm studying at WashU, but half a year ago I was working as a software engineer at Korea Securities Depository (KSD) in Korea more than 13 years. (If you are interested in my resume, click [**here**](https://github.com/kbckbc/portfolio/blob/main/resume_bcgwak.pdf))
I have experience in developing systems with many users, cooperative development for large-scale systems, and finally, I have a sense of challenge.
It has been a long time dream of me to work in the US, and I am challenging the process. I’m still working on finding the dots as in Steve Jobs' speech.
