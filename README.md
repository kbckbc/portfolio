## Who am I?
I currently attend WashU, but half a year ago I was working as a software engineer at Korea Securities Depository (KSD) in Korea for over 13 years. 
I have experience in developing systems with many users, cooperative development for large-scale systems, and finally, I have a sense of challenge.
It has been a long time dream of me to work in the US, and I am challenging the process. I’m still working on finding the dots as in Steve Jobs' speech. Thanks for reading.
